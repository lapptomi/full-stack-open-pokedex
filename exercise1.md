I chose Python as the programming language to discuss.

For linting Python code one popular choise for this would be Pylint. Pylint can be customized with many settings to fit your needs. It is a static code analysis tool and helps to find any errors on the code, and keeps the quality of the code better.

For testing purposes the Robot framework would be a good choise. It is open source and can be used for test automation. When using robot framework the tests are also readable to people with no much technical knowledge, because of the behavior driven development.
 
There is no need for the building process with Python as the course material says.

Good alternative for Github Actions and Jenkins would be Travis CI for example.

For team of about 6 people I think this setup would be better in a cloud-based environment, because then there is no need for a hosting the services and other unnecessary work for a small team like this.

But that of course depends on the situation. For example if the project has to be very secure, then it might be a problem to use some hosting services on cloud, because then they would have access to the source code, and that might cause some security issues.

So generally I think it depends on the situation, that should you use a self-hosted or a cloud-based environment.
